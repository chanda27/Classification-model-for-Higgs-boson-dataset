# Classification-model-for-Higgs-boson-dataset

The project presents a classification system for Higgs Boson decay based on Artificial Neural Networks and SVM. Higgs Boson dataset from Kaggle has been used for testing the model. The system has been made more accurate and time efficient by the use of Genetic Algorithm which selects optimal feature subset form total features and ultimately enhances the systemâ€™s classification accuracy. The overall accuracy achieved by the system is 98.31 percent which shows the potential of the system to be used for practical purposes.
